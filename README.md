# Quantum-Computation-and-Quantum-Information-Problems-and-Exercises
This is a community-driven collection of problems, exercises, sample code, self-paced tutorials and other educational materials that can be used to support classes that teach quantum computing and quantum information theory.

As a starting point, we have recreated the table of contents of the book Quantum Computation and Quantum Information (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Information), also known as "Mike and Ike" so that contributions can be associated with the relevant sections of this very commonly used textbook.
